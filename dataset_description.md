# üß† Brain Tumor MRI Dataset

This dataset is widely used in deep learning research for **tumor detection and classification**.
## Overview
This dataset contains **7,023 MRI images** classified into four tumor types:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

The dataset is a combination of three sources: **Figshare, SARTAJ, and Br35H**.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
- The **SARTAJ dataset** had incorrectly categorized glioma images. These were replaced with images from the **Figshare dataset**.
- MRI images have **varying sizes**, so resizing is necessary for preprocessing.
